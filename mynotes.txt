Testing notes for Backend JWT

https://www.bezkoder.com/jwt-refresh-token-node-js/

what this sequence does is you login a user,
the user gets an authentication token
that token is passed to the zombieTrackers...
and enables access to the zombieTrackers list of people

create the new user - post
https://localhost:3500/register

***

login the user - post
https://localhost:3500/auth

returns a authorization tokens

***
-not working at the moment - says forbidden
but bearer with token is still showing up on zombieTrackers, but getting Forbidden - did the token expire?
see auth controller for time allocated?

get the token at - under auth
https://localhost:3500/zombieTrackers
should return a list of those in that database
and bearer with token should be in the output



*** TODO FIX THIS - the access token is not being generated
it might be that the httpcookie is not being sent?
refresh token needs a longer duration

cookie is created verification post - (works)
https://localhost:3500/auth
you'll see the cookie returned

https://localhost:3500/refresh
get (have nothing in the body)
new access token should be generated

********
TODO  cookie logout is failing

register a user
authenticate the user
logout the user -- throws a 401
the client request has not been completed because it lacks valid authentication credentials for the requested resource.
